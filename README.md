#  *Big Data, Graphs, and Learning* 


Our reading group meets from 3 to 5 in  [MCS B08](https://www.google.com/maps/place/111+Cummington+Mall,+Boston,+MA+02215/@42.3490961,-71.106378,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e379f0c4ef07c1:0xae092ed802b7f90a!8m2!3d42.3490961!4d-71.1041893).   Email Babis (tsourolampis at gmail.com) if you want to present a paper, or for any questions.
